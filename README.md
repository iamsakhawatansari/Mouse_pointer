# Mouse_Control_using_hand_gesture

#It is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions performed by your mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. Simply speaking, a camera captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor and perform a left-click, right-click, drag, select and scroll up and down. The predefined gestures make use of only three fingers marked by different colours.
